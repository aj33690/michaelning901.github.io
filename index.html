											<h2>About Us</h2>
										</header>
										<p> Founded in 2014, PepTalk is a free student mentorship program that recruits nationally competitive high school debaters to mentor and support other students without the same resources of more well-established programs. Our (and our mentors’) vision for debate is one where all students’ passion and determination for the activity determine their success, while the level of resources they have access is not an obstacle. PepTalk maintains a 1:1 Mentor to Mentee ratio, ensuring each mentee receives personalized attention. <b>We want to stress the fact that mentors are not “coaches”—they are peers who are meant to support under-resourced debaters navigating the national circuit.</b>
